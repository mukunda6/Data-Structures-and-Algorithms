# Queue

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the  
**FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.

The element inserted first is removed first.

## Basic Operations
- **Enqueue** – Insert an element at the rear
- **Dequeue** – Remove an element from the front
- **Front / Peek** – View the front element
- **IsEmpty** – Check whether the queue is empty

## Types of Queues
- Simple Queue
- Circular Queue
- Priority Queue
- Deque (Double Ended Queue)

## Common Applications
- CPU scheduling
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Producer–Consumer problems
- Task scheduling
- Handling requests in order

## Queue Problems Covered
Each file in this folder represents **one queue-based DSA problem**.

Examples:
- Implement Queue using Stack
- Implement Stack using Queue
- Circular Queue
- First Non-Repeating Character in a Stream
- Sliding Window Maximum

## Time Complexity
| Operation | Time Complexity |
|---------|----------------|
| Enqueue | O(1) |
| Dequeue | O(1) |
| Front | O(1) |

## Implementation
Most solutions use:
- `queue` from C++ STL
- `deque` where required
- Custom queue implementation for practice

All solutions are written with **interview preparation** in mind and include
clear logic, comments, and time–space complexity.
