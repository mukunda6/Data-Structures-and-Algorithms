# Bit Manipulation

**Bit Manipulation** involves working directly with binary
representations of numbers using bitwise operators.

It is one of the **most important topics for coding interviews**
due to its efficiency and low-level control.

## Bitwise Operators
| Operator | Name | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| & | AND | a & b |
| \| | OR | a \| b |
| ^ | XOR | a ^ b |
| ~ | NOT | ~a |
| << | Left Shift | a << 1 |
| >> | Right Shift | a >> 1 |

## Common Applications
- Checking even / odd numbers
- Power of Two / Three / Four
- Counting set bits
- Finding unique elements
- Swapping numbers without temp
- Bit masking

## Bit Manipulation Problems Covered
Each file in this folder represents **one bit-manipulation-based problem**.

Examples:
- Power of Two
- Count Set Bits
- Single Number
- Missing Number
- Reverse Bits

## Time & Space Advantages
- Extremely fast operations
- Constant time complexity
- Minimal extra memory usage

## Interview Tips
- Powers of two have **only one set bit**
- `n & (n - 1)` removes the lowest set bit
- XOR cancels duplicate numbers

📌 **Note:**  
Bit manipulation problems often have **O(1)** solutions.
Mastering them gives a big advantage in interviews.
