# Backtracking (DSA Problems)

This folder contains **Backtracking-based algorithms**, a powerful technique
used to solve problems by exploring all possible solutions and undoing choices
when a solution path fails.

Backtracking is commonly asked in **coding interviews** and **competitive programming**.

---

## 🔁 What is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a recursive problem-solving technique where:
- We build a solution step by step
- If a step leads to an invalid solution, we **backtrack**
- Try another possibility

---

## 🧠 Key Characteristics
- Uses recursion
- Explores decision trees
- Prunes invalid paths early
- Often exponential time complexity

---

## 📌 Common Backtracking Problems
- Subsets
- Permutations
- Combinations
- Combination Sum
- N-Queens
- Sudoku Solver
- Palindrome Partitioning
- Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

---

## 📂 File Naming Convention
Each file represents **one backtracking problem**.

Example:
- 01_Subsets.cpp
- 02_Permutations.cpp
- 03_Combinations.cpp
- 04_Combination_Sum.cpp
- 05_N_Queens.cpp
- 06_Palindrome_Partitioning.cpp
- 07_Letter_Combinations.cpp

---

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity
- Time: Often **O(2ⁿ)** or **O(n!)**
- Space: **O(n)** (recursion stack + path storage)

---

📌 **Tip:**  
Always think in terms of:
1. **Choice**
2. **Explore**
3. **Backtrack**
