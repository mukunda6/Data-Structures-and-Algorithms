# Binary Tree (DSA Problems)

This folder contains **Binary Tree** based Data Structures and Algorithms problems.
Binary Trees are one of the most important topics for **coding interviews**.

## 🌳 What is a Binary Tree?
A Binary Tree is a tree data structure in which:
- Each node has **at most two children**
- Children are referred to as **left child** and **right child**

---

## 🔁 Traversal Techniques
- Inorder Traversal (Left → Root → Right)
- Preorder Traversal (Root → Left → Right)
- Postorder Traversal (Left → Right → Root)
- Level Order Traversal (BFS)

---

## 🧠 Common Binary Tree Problems
- Tree Traversals
- Height / Maximum Depth
- Minimum Depth
- Diameter of Binary Tree
- Symmetric Tree
- Invert Binary Tree
- Path Sum
- Lowest Common Ancestor (Binary Tree)

---

## 📂 File Naming Convention
Each file represents **one Binary Tree problem**.

Example:
- 01_Inorder_Traversal.cpp
- 02_Preorder_Traversal.cpp
- 03_Postorder_Traversal.cpp
- 04_Level_Order_Traversal.cpp
- 05_Max_Depth_of_Binary_Tree.cpp
- 06_Symmetric_Tree.cpp
- 07_Invert_Binary_Tree.cpp

---

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity
Most Binary Tree problems:
- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(h) where `h` is the height of the tree

---

📌 **Tip:**  
Use **recursion** first.  
Then think about **iterative / BFS** solutions.
