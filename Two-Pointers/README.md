# Two Pointers Technique (DSA)

This repository contains **Data Structures & Algorithms problems**
solved using the **Two Pointers technique** with clean and optimized
**C++ implementations**.

The Two Pointers approach is widely used in **coding interviews**
to reduce time complexity from **O(n²) to O(n)**.

## 🔍 What is Two Pointers?
Two Pointers is a technique where:
- Two indices are used to traverse a data structure
- Pointers move based on conditions
- Commonly applied on **arrays and strings**

---

## 🧠 Common Two Pointer Patterns

### 1️⃣ Left & Right Pointers
- One pointer starts from the beginning
- Another from the end
- Used in palindrome, reverse string, container problems

### 2️⃣ Slow & Fast Pointers
- One pointer moves slow
- Another moves fast
- Used in duplicate removal, cycle detection

### 3️⃣ Shrinking / Expanding Window
- Adjust pointers based on conditions
- Used in sorted arrays and optimization problems

## 📂 Problems Covered
Each file represents **one Two Pointer problem**.

Example problems:
- Reverse String
- Two Sum (Sorted Array)
- Move Zeroes
- Valid Palindrome
- Container With Most Water
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- Squares of a Sorted Array

---

## ⏱ Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (in-place operations)

---

## 📌 When to Use Two Pointers?
Use this technique when:
- Array or string is **sorted**
- You need to compare elements from both ends
- Nested loops can be optimized

---

## 🎯 Interview Tip
Always ask yourself:
> Can I solve this problem using two pointers instead of nested loops?

If yes → **Use Two Pointers!** 🚀

Happy Coding 😊
