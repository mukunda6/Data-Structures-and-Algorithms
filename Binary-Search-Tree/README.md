# 🌳 Binary Search Tree — Complete DSA Repository (C++)

This repository contains implementations of **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
concepts and interview problems in **C++**.

Designed for:

* DSA Practice
* Coding Interviews
* Competitive Programming
* Quick Revision

---

## 📌 What is a BST?

A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree where:

Left Subtree → values < root
Right Subtree → values > root

This allows:

* Fast search
* Ordered traversal
* Efficient insert/delete

## ⚡ Complexity

| Operation | Average  | Worst |
| --------- | -------- | ----- |
| Search    | O(log n) | O(n)  |
| Insert    | O(log n) | O(n)  |
| Delete    | O(log n) | O(n)  |
