# 📊 Dynamic Programming (DP)

This folder contains **Dynamic Programming problems**
implemented in **C++** with clear explanations.

Dynamic Programming is used to solve problems by:
- Breaking them into subproblems
- Storing results to avoid recomputation

---

## 🔹 Types of DP

### 1️⃣ Memoization (Top-Down)
- Uses recursion + cache
- Avoids repeated calculations

### 2️⃣ Tabulation (Bottom-Up)
- Uses iteration
- Builds solution from base cases

---

## 📂 Problems Covered
- Fibonacci (Memoization & Tabulation)
- Climbing Stairs
- House Robber
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Coin Change
- Subset Sum

---

## ⏱ Complexity
- Time: O(n) / O(n×m)
- Space: O(n) / O(n×m)

---

## 🎯 Interview Tip
If recursion has **overlapping subproblems** → use DP 🚀
