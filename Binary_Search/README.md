# Binary Search

**Binary Search** is an efficient searching algorithm used on
**sorted arrays or lists**.

It works by repeatedly dividing the search space into half.

## Prerequisite
- The array must be **sorted**
- Random access should be possible (array / vector)

## How Binary Search Works
1. Find the middle element
2. If target == middle → found
3. If target < middle → search left half
4. If target > middle → search right half
5. Repeat until found or search space becomes empty

## Types of Binary Search
- Iterative Binary Search
- Recursive Binary Search
- Binary Search on Answer
- Lower Bound / Upper Bound
- First & Last Occurrence

## Common Applications
- Searching in sorted arrays
- Finding boundaries
- Optimization problems
- Competitive programming problems

## Binary Search Problems Covered
Each file in this folder represents **one binary-search-based problem**.

Examples:
- Binary Search (Basic)
- First and Last Position of Element
- Search Insert Position
- Square Root of a Number
- Peak Element
- Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Time & Space Complexity
| Approach | Time | Space |
|-------|------|-------|
| Iterative | O(log n) | O(1) |
| Recursive | O(log n) | O(log n) |
