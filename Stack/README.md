# Stack

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.
The element inserted last is removed first.

## Basic Operations
- **Push** – Insert an element into the stack
- **Pop** – Remove the top element from the stack
- **Top / Peek** – View the top element
- **IsEmpty** – Check whether the stack is empty

## Common Applications
- Checking balanced parentheses
- Undo / Redo operations
- Expression evaluation (Postfix / Prefix)
- Function calls (Call Stack)
- Backtracking problems

## Stack Problems Covered
Each file in this folder represents **one stack-based DSA problem**.

Examples:
- Valid Parentheses
- Min Stack
- Next Greater Element
- Daily Temperatures
- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

## Time & Space Complexity
| Operation | Time Complexity |
|---------|----------------|
| Push | O(1) |
| Pop | O(1) |
| Top | O(1) |

## Implementation
Most problems in this folder use:
- `stack` from C++ STL
- Array-based or custom stack when required
