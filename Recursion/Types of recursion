# 🔁 Recursion – Complete Guide (C++)

This repository contains a **complete guide to Recursion**
with **definitions, types, and C++ programs**.

Recursion is one of the most important concepts in
**Data Structures, Algorithms, and Interviews**.

---

## 🔹 What is Recursion?

Recursion is a programming technique where a function
calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into
smaller sub-problems.

Every recursive function must have:
- **Base Case** – stops recursion
- **Recursive Case** – function calls itself

---

## 📚 Types of Recursion Covered

### 1️⃣ Direct Recursion
A function calls itself directly.

**Example:** Factorial  
📌 Used in: factorial, sum, power

---

### 2️⃣ Indirect Recursion
A function calls another function which then calls the first function.

📌 Used in: mutually dependent logic

---

### 3️⃣ Tail Recursion
Recursive call is the **last statement** in the function.

📌 Faster & memory efficient  
⚠️ C++ may optimize it

---

### 4️⃣ Non-Tail (Head) Recursion
Some work is done **after** the recursive call.

📌 Output depends on return path

---

### 5️⃣ Linear Recursion
Only **one recursive call** per function call.

📌 Time Complexity: **O(n)**

---

### 6️⃣ Binary Recursion
Function makes **two recursive calls**.

📌 Example: Fibonacci  
📌 Time Complexity: **O(2ⁿ)**

---

### 7️⃣ Multiple (Tree) Recursion
More than **two recursive calls**.

📌 Used in: tree problems, DP

---

### 8️⃣ Nested Recursion
A recursive call inside another recursive call.

📌 Rare but asked in exams

---

### 9️⃣ Mutual Recursion
Two or more functions call each other.

📌 Used in: odd-even checks

---

### 🔟 Tree Recursion
Each call generates multiple child calls.

📌 Used in: backtracking, tree traversal

---

## 📊 Recursion Types Summary

| Type | Recursive Calls | Example |
|-----|-----------------|---------|
| Direct | 1 | Factorial |
| Indirect | ≥2 | A → B → A |
| Tail | 1 (last) | Optimized factorial |
| Non-Tail | 1 | Print numbers |
| Linear | 1 | Sum |
| Binary | 2 | Fibonacci |
| Multiple | >2 | Staircase |
| Nested | Inside call | McCarthy |
| Mutual | 2 functions | Odd-Even |
| Tree | Many | Backtracking |

---

## 🎯 Interview Tips
- Always identify the **base case**
- Draw the **recursion tree**
- Know **time & space complexity**
- Convert recursion to iteration if needed

---

## 🚀 Best Way to Learn Recursion
1. Trace with small inputs
2. Dry run on paper
3. Understand call stack
4. Practice problems daily

Happy Learning 🔥  
Recursion becomes easy once you **visualize the calls** 🙂
