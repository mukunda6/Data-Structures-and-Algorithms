# Recursion

**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function
calls itself to solve a problem.

Each recursive solution has:
- **Base Case** – stops the recursion
- **Recursive Case** – breaks the problem into smaller subproblems

## Key Concepts
- Base Case
- Recursive Call
- Call Stack
- Backtracking

## How Recursion Works
1. Function calls itself
2. Each call is stored in the call stack
3. Base case stops further calls
4. Stack unwinds and returns results

## Common Applications
- Factorial & Fibonacci
- Tree and Graph traversal
- Backtracking problems
- Divide and Conquer algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (top-down)

## Recursion Problems Covered
Each file in this folder represents **one recursion-based problem**.

Examples:
- Factorial of a Number
- Fibonacci Number
- Reverse a String
- Check Palindrome
- Print All Subsets
- Generate Parentheses
- Tower of Hanoi

## Time & Space Complexity
| Type | Complexity |
|----|------------|
| Simple Recursion | Depends on depth |
| Tail Recursion | Optimizable |
| Backtracking | Exponential |

📌 **Note:**  
Always define a **base case** to avoid infinite recursion.
Recursion is heavily tested in **interviews**.
